Implement the code for binary representation of a given number

Technical Questions:
 make a bst from a sorted array
 egg floor problem
 coin puzzle
 find all permutation of strings


The first round was a technical round. It involved writing code on laptop for elevator algorithm. The problem was quite complex and based on graph data structure. we had to find the minimum waiting time and the path also



Questions asked on DS, Multithreading, basics of OOPS.

Regarding the first interview, for the first round, write JAVA code to create a deadlock.The interviewer really helped me a lot by giving hints.Next question is to come up with an algorithm to randomly select a item from a list.Catch is you cannot select already selected item ( like play random song from a list of songs).Next question is given an function which will
return 1 or 0
with equal probability, write another function using the first function which returns 0 with 25 % and 1 with 75 % probability.

Regarding
the
next
round, write
code
to
find
power
of
a
number.Then, he
asksed
all
the
testcases.Next
question is when
to
use
interface and when
to
use
abstract


class . I answered all the questions.

Basic Algorithms, Linked List, Stack, Queue


Round1: Consider a linkedlist with nodes have next pointer and random pointer. Replicate the list
Round2: Find out if linkedlist is cyclic. If it is cyclic, remove the cycle.
Round3: You are given array of strings, a starting word , an ending word. Design Algorithm and code(any language) to give the shortest path from starting word to ending word, if a path exists. You can move between one word to another by only changing one character in each word. Time: 30 minutes
Example array-{"cat", "bot", "bat", "bog", "mat"}, starting word-cat , ending word-bog
Output: Path exists
Path: cat->bat->bot->bog
I could not solve this problem during the interview. This can be done by constructing a graph and using the shortest path algorithm. Each word would be a node in your graph and it connects to a word which differs only by one character. Ex: cat connects to bat and mat

Question in Round 3 on graphs and shortest path



Most of the questions are related to datastructures and algorithms. Be thorough with Linked Lists, Binary Trees and Strings
