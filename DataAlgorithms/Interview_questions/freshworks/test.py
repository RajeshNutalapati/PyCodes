General Tips
● Go over data structures, algorithms and complexity inorder to be able to discuss the big-O
complexity of your approaches.

● Brush up on your data structures - lists, arrays, hash tables, hash maps, stacks, queues,
graphs, trees, inheritance, heaps. Also sorts, searches, and traversals (BFS, DFS).

● To help prepare for your interviews, check out some videos of Gayle Laakmann McDowell

● Review recursion and iterative approaches.

● Be sure to practice questions in a variety of subjects and difficulty levels.

Rounds of Interview
Following will be the rounds of interview
1. Round 1 : Problem Solving and coding
2. Round 2: DS and Algo
3. Round 3: Overall Technical Fit 1
4. Round 4: Overall Technical fit 2
5. Round 4: HR
Note : The overall rounds of interview is contingent to feedback.

Round 1: Problem Solving and Coding
1. Please be watchful of edge cases, corner cases, null cases. Although this is a F2F interview
and you will be asked to write code in a piece of paper, please make sure its a compilable
code.

2. Make sure space and time complexity is taken care of and the code is most optimised

3. Be aware of what cases would break your code

Round 2 : Design

1. Prepare to write both High level design and LLD
2. Be prepared to talk through your current design in depth. Be prepared to take questions on
why do you deem that your current design is the best approach.

3. Go through freshworks architecture videos and articles, we would discuss web-scale
application architectures

4. Expectation is that you are able to make right architectural choices given a set of use cases.

call-out compromises as well as ask the right questions.

5. Please consider scalability of your design while proposing your solution

Round 3: Overall Technical Assessment
We are looking hiring candidates that can operate as leaders. In that essence, we are looking at someone
who has an overall understanding of the code. Please prepare to talk on the following aswell
1. Impact of your code in the overall SDLC
2. Understand the impact of the code in QA phase. What are the best coding practises that would
make the readability (commenting, spacing and other code quality)of the code easier in the QA
phase.
3. Prepare to talk about your contribution to a project vs. the teams. Tech process improvement that
you have driven with tangible metrics (eg. reduction in latency)
4. How does your current application get deployed? Following are some examples to assess your
knowledge depth in deployment
a. What is your current code coverage
b. How many machines do you use in deployment
c. Is the application stateless

bfs = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7
dfs = 1,2,4,5,3,6
