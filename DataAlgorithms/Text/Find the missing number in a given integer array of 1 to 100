Condition - No duplicates in the list
Now there are n integers but you will be given with n-1 integer because one element is missing
Elements doesnt necessarily have to be sorted

Time Complexity : O(n)

Approach 1
1. Get the sum of numbers
       total = n*(n+1)/2
2  Subtract all the numbers from sum and
   you will get the missing number.
