The "diamond problem" (sometimes referred to as the "deadly diamond of death") is the generally
used term for an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from a superclass A,
and another class D inherits from both B and C.
If there is a method "m" in A that B or C (or even both of them) )has overridden,
and furthermore, if does not override this method, then the question is
which version of the method does D inherit? It could be the one from A, B or C
