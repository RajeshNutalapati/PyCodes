1. Range is a generator

2. an integer is not mutable, so it cannot change, so when you assign a new value to an integer,
you're actually assigning an entirely different object to the name.
The original integer is not changed, the name simply refers to a new object.
Passing a value to a function acts exactly the same way. A reference to the object is passed and acts exactly like an assignment.
So mutable objects may be changed, and those changes will be reflected in the caller. Immutable objects may not be changed

3. yield is like return but instead it continues to run the loop until it goes to the next value
