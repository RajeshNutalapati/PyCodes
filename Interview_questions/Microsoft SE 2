Proactively identifies opportunities for Reuse within the applications and across the groups.
Drive feedback from production systems based on telemetry and make the product robust by building strong engineering backlog.
Providing time and resource estimates for features / applications.
Participate and drive design, architecture, and code reviews.
Influence engineering team's implementation methodology
